    [server]$ sudo ipa-server-install --no-host-dns --mkhomedir

    The log file for this installation can be found in /var/log/ipaserver-install.log
    ==============================================================================
    This program will set up the FreeIPA Server.

    This includes:
    * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
    * Configure the NTP client (chronyd)
    * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
    * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
    * Configure Apache (httpd)
    * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT

    To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.

    Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: yes

    Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
    on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
    <hostname>.<domainname>
    Example: master.example.com.


    Server host name [server.ipademo.local]: 

    Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host server.ipademo.local
    The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

    Please confirm the domain name [ipademo.local]: 

    The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
    This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

    Please provide a realm name [IPADEMO.LOCAL]: 
    Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
    This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
    to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
    instance of directory server created for IPA.
    The password must be at least 8 characters long.

    Directory Manager password: 
    Password (confirm): 

    The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
    This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

    IPA admin password: 
    Password (confirm): 

    Checking DNS domain ipademo.local., please wait ...
    Do you want to configure DNS forwarders? [yes]: no
    No DNS forwarders configured
    Do you want to search for missing reverse zones? [yes]: 
    Do you want to create reverse zone for IP 192.168.33.10 [yes]: 
    Please specify the reverse zone name [33.168.192.in-addr.arpa.]: 
    Using reverse zone(s) 33.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

    The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
    Hostname:       server.ipademo.local
    IP address(es): 192.168.33.10
    Domain name:    ipademo.local
    Realm name:     IPADEMO.LOCAL

    The CA will be configured with:
    Subject DN:   CN=Certificate Authority,O=IPADEMO.LOCAL
    Subject base: O=IPADEMO.LOCAL
    Chaining:     self-signed

    BIND DNS server will be configured to serve IPA domain with:
    Forwarders:       No forwarders
    Forward policy:   only
    Reverse zone(s):  33.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

    Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes

    The following operations may take some minutes to complete.

    ==============================================================================
    Setup complete

    Next steps:
            1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
                    TCP Ports:
                      * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
                      * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
                      * 88, 464: kerberos
                      * 53: bind
                    UDP Ports:
                      * 88, 464: kerberos
                      * 53: bind
                      * 123: ntp

            2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
               This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
               and the web user interface.

        Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
        These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
        files is the Directory Manager password
